# NekoRay / NekoBox For PC

Qt based cross-platform GUI proxy configuration manager (backend: sing-box)

Support Windows / Linux / MacOS out of the box now. Windows7 is also supported, but requires some additional changes to run it.

This Project was adopted and developed since the original author had left it, now that arm64v8a has started to update the app again, I might stop maintaining this repo depending on the situation.

### Using Tun mode in MacOS
To use Tun mode in MacOS, you need to open the app as root.

Open the app like this:

```shell
sudo /Applications/nekoray.app/Contents/MacOS/nekoray
```

It will open a Nekoray instance with no configurations; if you have configured your Nekoray in normal mode, close the app and do this to copy them:

**`Note:`** Replace `YOU` with your username

```shell
sudo cp -r /Users/YOU/Library/Preferences/nekoray/ /private/var/root/Library/Preferences/nekoray
```

Now, you can open it with the first command.
